8470109,"Using stochastic geometry, this article studies the retransmission performance in uplink cellular networks with fractional path-loss inversion power control (FPC). We first show that the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) is correlated across time, which imposes temporal diversity loss in the retransmission performance. In particular, FPC with lower path-loss compensation factor decreases inter-cell interference but suffers from degraded retransmission diversity. On the other hand, full path-loss inversion achieves almost full temporal diversity (i.e., temporal SIR independence) at the expense of increased inter-cell interference. To this end, the results show that ramping-down the power upon transmission failure improves the overall coverage probability in interference-limited uplink networks.",R. Arshad and L. H.

SANA2014192,"Abstract In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for wireless monitoring of the respiratory movements in humans. Our scheme overcomes the challenges low signal-to-noise ratio, background clutter and high sampling rates. It is based on the estimation of the ultra-wideband channel impulse response. We suggest techniques for dealing with background clutter in situations when it might be time variant. We also present a novel methodology for reducing the required sampling rate of the system significantly while achieving the accuracy offered by the Nyquist rate. Performance results from simulations conducted with pre-recorded respiratory signals demonstrate the robustness of our scheme for tackling the above challenges and providing a low-complexity solution for the monitoring of respiratory movements.","Sana, Furrukh and Ballal, Tarig and Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y and Hoteit, Ibrahim",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2013.11.004,1746-8094,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,Supplement C,192--200,Low-complexity wireless monitoring of respiratory movements using ultra-wideband impulse response estimation,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809413001614,10,2014,,Published,Feb,2014-02-01 00:00:00,,

8359365,"This paper considers the problem of selecting a set of k measurements from n available sensor observations. The selected measurements should minimize a certain error function assessing the error in estimating a certain m dimensional parameter vector. The exhaustive search inspecting each of the (n/k) possible choices would require a very high computational complexity and as such is not practical for large n and k. Alternative methods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main drawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix and 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix. To overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which k, n and m grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then used to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are commonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select properly k measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error measures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists in applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure. The second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look for a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The greedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error measures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions. We present two potential applications where the proposed algorithms can be used, namely antenna selection for uplink transmissions in large scale multi-user systems and sensor selection for wireless sensor networks. Numerical results are also presented and sustain the efficiency of the proposed blind methods in reaching the performances of channel-aware algorithms.",K. Elkhalil and A. Kammoun and T. Y.

8340240,"Cache-enabled small base station (SBS) densification is foreseen as a key component of 5G cellular networks. This architecture enables storing popular files at the network edge (i.e., SBS caches), which empowers local communication and alleviates traffic congestions at the core/backhaul network. This paper develops a mathematical framework, based on stochastic geometry, to characterize the hit probability in a multi-channel cache-enabled 5G networks with both unicast/multicast capabilities and opportunistic spectrum access. To this end, we first derive the hit probability by characterizing the opportunistic spectrum access success probabilities, service distance distributions, and coverage probabilities. An optimization framework for file caching is then developed to maximize this hit probability. To this end, a simple concave approximation for the hit probability is proposed, which highly reduces the optimization complexity and leads to a closed-form solution. The sub-optimal solution is benchmarked against two widely employed caching distribution schemes, namely uniform and Zipf caching, through numerical results and extensive simulations. It is shown that the caching strategy should be adapted to the network parameters and capabilities. For instance, diversifying file caching according to the Zipf distribution is better in multicast systems with large number of channels. However, when the number of channels is low and/or the network is restricted to unicast transmissions, it is better to confine the caching to the most popular files only.",M. Emara and H.

8168426,"Conventional cloud radio access networks (CRANs) assume single cloud processing and treat inter-cloud interference as background noise. This paper considers the downlink of a multi-CRAN where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) through limited-capacity wireline backhaul links. The set of BSs connected to each cloud, called cluster, serves a set of pre-known mobile users. The performance of the system becomes therefore a function of both inter-cloud and intra-cloud interference, as well as the compression schemes of the limited capacity backhaul links. This paper assumes independent compression scheme and imperfect channel state information (CSI) where the CSI errors belong to an ellipsoidal bounded region. The problem of interest becomes one of minimizing the network total transmit power subject to BS power and quality of service constraints, as well as backhaul capacity and CSI error constraints. This paper suggests solving the problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). One highlight of this paper is that the proposed ADMM-based algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion across the multi-cloud network by allowing a limited amount of information exchange between the coupled clouds. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm provides a similar performance to the centralized algorithm in a reasonable number of iterations.",O. Dhif-Allah and H. Dahrouj and T.

8488506,"Location is one of the basic information required for underwater optical wireless sensor networks (UOWSNs) for different purposes such as relating the sensing measurements with precise sensor positions, enabling efficient geographic routing techniques, and sustaining link connectivity between the nodes. Even though various two-dimensional UOWSNs localization methods have been proposed in the past, the directive nature of optical wireless communications and three-dimensional (3D) deployment of sensors require to develop 3D underwater localization methods. Additionally, the localization accuracy of the network strongly depends on the placement of the anchors. Therefore, we propose a robust 3D localization method for partially connected UOWSNs which can accommodate the outliers and optimize the placement of the anchors to improve the localization accuracy. The proposed method formulates the problem of missing pairwise distances and outliers as an optimization problem which is solved through half quadratic minimization. Furthermore, analysis is provided to optimally place the anchors in the network which improves the localization accuracy. The problem of optimal anchor placement is formulated as a combination of Fisher information matrices for the sensor nodes where the condition of D-optimality is satisfied. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the literature substantially in the presence of outliers.",N. Saeed and T. Y. Al-Naffouri and M.

Ali2017,"Conventional algorithms used for parameter estimation in colocated multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radars require the inversion of the covariance matrix of the received spatial samples. In these algorithms, the number of received snapshots should be at least equal to the size of the covariance matrix. For large size MIMO antenna arrays, the inversion of the covariance matrix becomes computationally very expensive. Compressive sensing (CS) algorithms which do not require the inversion of the complete covariance matrix can be used for parameter estimation with fewer number of received snapshots. In this work, it is shown that the spatial formulation is best suitable for large MIMO arrays when CS algorithms are used. A temporal formulation is proposed which fits the CS algorithms framework, especially for small size MIMO arrays. A recently proposed low-complexity CS algorithm named support agnostic Bayesian matching pursuit (SABMP) is used to estimate target parameters for both spatial and temporal formulations for the unknown number of targets. The simulation results show the advantage of SABMP algorithm utilizing low number of snapshots and better parameter estimation for both small and large number of antenna elements. Moreover, it is shown by simulations that SABMP is more effective than other existing algorithms at high signal-to-noise ratio.",H. Ali and S. Ahmed and T. Y. Al-Naffouri and M. S. Sharawi and M. S.

SULIMAN201835,"Estimating the values of unknown parameters in ill-posed problems from corrupted measured data presents formidable challenges in ill-posed problems. In such problems, many of the fundamental estimation methods fail to provide meaningful stabilized solutions. In this work, we propose a new regularization approach combined with a new regularization-parameter selection method for linear least-squares discrete ill-posed problems called constrained perturbation regularization approach (COPRA). The proposed COPRA is based on perturbing the singular-value structure of the linear model matrix to enhance the stability of the problem solution. Unlike many regularization methods that seek to minimize the estimated data error, the proposed approach is developed to minimize the mean-squared error of the estimator, which is the objective in many estimation scenarios. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large set of real-world discrete ill-posed problems. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms a set of benchmark regularization methods in most cases. In addition, the approach enjoys the shortest runtime and offers the highest level of robustness of all the tested benchmark regularization methods.",Mohamed A. Suliman and Tarig Ballal and Tareq Y.

8119869,"This paper addresses the problem of blind demixing of instantaneous mixtures in a multiple-input multiple-output communication system. The main objective is to present efficient blind source separation (BSS) algorithms dedicated to moderate or high-order QAM constellations. Four new iterative batch BSS algorithms are presented dealing with the multimodulus (MM) and alphabet matched (AM) criteria. For the optimization of these cost functions, iterative methods of Givens and hyperbolic rotations are used. A pre-whitening operation is also utilized to reduce the complexity of design problem. It is noticed that the designed algorithms using Givens rotations gives satisfactory performance only for large number of samples. However, for small number of samples, the algorithms designed by combining both Givens and hyperbolic rotations compensate for the ill-whitening that occurs in this case and thus improves the performance. Two algorithms dealing with the MM criterion are presented for moderate order QAM signals such as 16-QAM. The other two dealing with the AM criterion are presented for high-order QAM signals. These methods are finally compared with the state of art batch BSS algorithms in terms of signal-to-interference and noise ratio, symbol error rate and convergence rate.

8100970,"Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength $\Omega$ becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system $\omega$. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large $\Omega$/$\omega$c=0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling $\Omega$ ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom.

8248776,"The radiation pattern of an antenna array depends on the excitation weights and the geometry of the array. Due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoor millimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial blockages from a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. Handheld devices are also subject to blockages from random finger placement and/or finger prints. These blockages cause absorption and scattering to the signal incident on the array, modify the array geometry, and distort the far-field radiation pattern of the array. This paper studies the effects of blockages on the far-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes several array diagnosis techniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. The proposed techniques jointly estimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and phase-shifts given knowledge of the angles of arrival/departure. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide satisfactory results in terms of fault detection with reduced number of measurements (diagnosis time) provided that the number of blockages is small compared to the array size.",M.

8027131,"Recent studies on cloud-radio access networks assume either signal-level or scheduling-level coordination. This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme as a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a multi-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links and, therefore, allows for joint signal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of backhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is composed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are maintained at a fixed power level. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to a single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. This paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The considered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a maximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be solved using efficient techniques. This paper then proposes solving the problem using both optimal and heuristic algorithms that can be implemented in a distributed fashion across the network. The proposed distributed algorithms rely on the well-chosen structure of the constructed conflict graph utilized to solve the maximum-weight independent set problem. Simulation results suggest that the proposed optimal and heuristic hybrid scheduling strategies provide appreciable gain as compared with the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with a negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.",A.

ELKHALIL20171,"Abstract This paper analyzes the statistical properties of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the Capon's minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers when operating over impulsive noises. Particularly, we consider the supervised case in which the receiver employs the regularized Tyler estimator in order to estimate the covariance matrix of the interference-plus-noise process using n observations of size N×1. The choice for the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE) is motivated by its resilience to the presence of outliers and its regularization parameter that guarantees a good conditioning of the covariance estimate. Of particular interest in this paper is the derivation of the second order statistics of the SINR. To achieve this goal, we consider two different approaches. The first one is based on considering the classical regime, referred to as the n-large regime, in which N is assumed to be fixed while n grows to infinity. The second approach is built upon recent results developed within the framework of random matrix theory and assumes that N and n grow large together.

ZERGUINE2009778,"Abstract The least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm is known for its fast convergence and lower steady state error, especially in sub-Gaussian noise environments. Recent work on normalised versions of the LMF algorithm has further enhanced its stability and performance in both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian noise environments. For example, the recently developed normalised LMF (XE-NLMF) algorithm is normalised by the mixed signal and error powers, and weighted by a fixed mixed-power parameter. Unfortunately, this algorithm depends on the selection of this mixing parameter. In this work, a time-varying mixed-power parameter technique is introduced to overcome this dependency. A convergence analysis, transient analysis, and steady-state behaviour of the proposed algorithm are derived and verified through simulations. An enhancement in performance is obtained through the use of this technique in two different scenarios. Moreover, the tracking analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in the presence of two sources of nonstationarities: (1) carrier frequency offset between transmitter and receiver and (2) random variations in the environment. Close agreement between analysis and simulation results is obtained. The results show that, unlike in the stationary case, the steady-state excess mean-square error is not a monotonically increasing function of the step size.",Azzedine Zerguine and Mun K.

Saeed2017,"Underwater wireless technologies demand to transmit at higher data rate for ocean exploration. Currently, large coverage is achieved by acoustic sensor networks with low data rate, high cost, high latency, high power consumption, and negative impact on marine mammals. Meanwhile, optical communication for underwater networks has the advantage of the higher data rate albeit for limited communication distances. Moreover, energy consumption is another major problem for underwater sensor networks, due to limited battery power and difficulty in replacing or recharging the battery of a sensor node. The ultimate solution to this problem is to add energy harvesting capability to the acoustic-optical sensor nodes. Localization of underwater sensor networks is of utmost importance because the data collected from underwater sensor nodes is useful only if the location of the nodes is known. Therefore, a novel localization technique for energy harvesting hybrid acoustic-optical underwater wireless sensor networks (AO-UWSNs) is proposed. AO-UWSN employs optical communication for higher data rate at a short transmission distance and employs acoustic communication for low data rate and long transmission distance. A hybrid received signal strength (RSS) based localization technique is proposed to localize the nodes in AO-UWSNs. The proposed technique combines the noisy RSS based measurements from acoustic communication and optical communication and estimates the final locations of acoustic-optical sensor nodes. A weighted multiple observations paradigm is proposed for hybrid estimated distances to suppress the noisy observations and give more importance to the accurate observations.

SANA201946,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are vital tools in assessing the health of the mother and the fetus during pregnancy. Extraction of fetal ECG (FECG) signal from the mother's abdominal recordings requires challenging signal processing tasks to eliminate the effects of the mother's ECG (MECG) signal, noise and other distortion sources. The availability of ECG data from multiple electrodes provides an opportunity to leverage the collective information in a collaborative manner. We propose a new scheme for extracting the fetal ECG signals from the abdominal ECG recordings of the mother using the multiple measurement vectors approach. The scheme proposes a dual dictionary framework that employs a learned dictionary for eliminating the MECG signals through sparse domain representation and a wavelet dictionary for the noise reduced sparse estimation of the fetal ECG signals. We also propose a novel methodology for inferring a single estimate of the fetal ECG source signal from the individual sensor estimates. Simulation results with real ECG recordings demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a comprehensive framework for eliminating the mother's ECG component in the abdominal recordings, effectively filters out noise and distortions, and leads to more accurate recovery of the fetal ECG source signal compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",Furrukh Sana and Tarig Ballal and Maha Shadaydeh and Ibrahim Hoteit and Tareq Y.

We exploit these constraints to derive a frequency domain maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel estimator. Furthermore, we develop a data aided (expectation maximization based) estimator incorporating frequency correlation information.

OWODUNNI2014282,"Abstract In this paper, compressed sensing techniques are proposed to linearize commercial power amplifiers driven by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals. The nonlinear distortion is considered as a sparse phenomenon in the time-domain, and three compressed sensing based algorithms are presented to estimate and compensate for these distortions at the receiver using a few and, at times, even no frequency-domain free carriers (i.e. pilot carriers). The first technique is a conventional compressed sensing approach, while the second incorporates a priori information about the distortions to enhance the estimation. Finally, the third technique involves an iterative data-aided algorithm that does not require any pilot carriers and hence allows the system to work at maximum bandwidth efficiency. The performances of all the proposed techniques are evaluated on a commercial power amplifier and compared. The error vector magnitude and symbol error rate results show the ability of compressed sensing to compensate for the amplifier's nonlinear distortions.","Owodunni, Damilola S and Ali, Anum and Quadeer, Ahmed A and Al-Safadi, Ebrahim B and Hammi, Oualid and Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2013.10.029,0165-1684,Signal Processing,Supplement C,282--293,Compressed sensing techniques for receiver based post-compensation of transmitter's nonlinear distortions in OFDM systems,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168413004209,97,2014,,Published,Feb,2014-02-01 00:00:00,"Compressed sensing,Data-aided estimation,Nonlinear distortion,Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing,Power amplifier",,,,,,,,
Zaib2014,"This paper investigates the joint maximum likelihood (ML) data detection and channel estimation problem for Alamouti space-time block-coded (STBC) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless systems. The joint ML estimation and data detection is generally considered a hard combinatorial optimization problem. We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm based on branch-estimate-bound strategy that renders exact joint ML solution. However, the computational complexity of blind algorithm becomes critical at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the number of OFDM carriers and constellation size are increased especially in multiple-antenna systems. To overcome this problem, a semi-blind algorithm based on a new framework for reducing the complexity is proposed by relying on subcarrier reordering and decoding the carriers with different levels of confidence using a suitable reliability criterion. In addition, it is shown that by utilizing the inherent structure of Alamouti coding, the estimation performance improvement or the complexity reduction can be achieved. The proposed algorithms can reliably track the wireless Rayleigh fading channel without requiring any channel statistics. Simulation results presented against the perfect coherent detection demonstrate the effectiveness of blind and semi-blind algorithms over frequency-selective channels with different fading characteristics.","Zaib, Alam and Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y",10.1186/1687-6180-2014-131,1687-6180,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,1,131,Blind and semi-blind ML detection for space-time block-coded OFDM wireless systems,https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2014-131,2014,2014,,Published,Aug,2014-08-01 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,

The proposed method finds the time delay from the room impulse response (RIR) which makes it robust against room reverberations. We consider the RIR as a sparse phenomenon and apply a recently proposed sparse signal reconstruction technique called orthogonal clustering (OC) for its estimation from the sub-sampled received signal. The arrival time of the direct path signal at a pair of microphones is identified from the estimated RIR, and their difference yields the desired time delay estimate (TDE). Low sampling rates reduces the hardware and computational complexity and decreases the communication between the microphones and the centralized location.

Douik2016,"This paper studies the delay reduction problem for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC)-based device-to-device (D2D) communication-enabled networks. Unlike conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) systems in which the wireless base station has the sufficient computation abilities, D2D networks rely on battery-powered operations of the devices. Therefore, a particular emphasis on the computation complexity needs to be addressed in the design of delay reduction algorithms for D2D networks. While most of the existing literature on IDNC directly extend the delay reduction PMP schemes, known to be NP-hard, to the D2D setting, this paper proposes to investigate and minimize the complexity of such algorithms for battery-powered devices. With delay minimization problems in IDNC-based systems being equivalent to a maximum weight clique problems in the IDNC graph, the presented algorithms, in this paper, can be applied to different delay aspects. This paper introduces and focuses on the reduction of the maximum value of the decoding delay as it represents the most general solution. The complexity of the solution is reduced by first proposing efficient methods for the construction, the update, and the dimension reduction of the IDNC graph. The paper, further, shows that, under particular scenarios, the problem boils down to a maximum clique problem. Due to the complexity of discovering such maximum clique, the paper presents a fast selection algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes and suggest that the proposed fast selection algorithm provides appreciable complexity gain as compared to the optimal selection one, with a negligible degradation in performance. In addition, they indicate that the running time of the proposed solution is close to the random selection algorithm.","Douik, Ahmed and Sorour, Sameh and Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y. and Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",10.1186/s13634-015-0293-z,1687-6180,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,1,1,Instantly decodable network coding for real-time device-to-device communications,https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-015-0293-z,2016,2016,,Published,Dec,2016-12-01 00:00:00,"Image and Speech Processing,Quantum Information Technology,Signal,Spintronics",,:C$\backslash$:/Users/Tamim/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Douik et al. - 2016 - Instantly decodable network coding for real-time device-to-device communications.pdf:pdf,Nature Publishing Group,,,,,

In dense 5Gnetworks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification.

In this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen densification throughputgains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best base station (BS) connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user trajectory, to maintain longer connection durations andreduce HO rates. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end,we consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO schemes in terms ofthe coverage probability and user throughput.

7145411,"Relay selection is a simple technique that achieves spatial diversity in cooperative relay networks. Generally, relay selection algorithms require channel state information(CSI) feedback from all cooperating relays to make a selection decision. This requirement poses two important challenges, which are often neglected in the literature. Firstly, the fedback channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. Secondly, CSI feedback generates a great deal of feedback overhead (air-time) that could result in significantperformance hits. In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based relay selection algorithm that reduces the feedback overhead of relay networks under the assumption ofnoisy feedback channels. The proposed algorithm exploits CS to first obtain the identity of a set of relays with favorable channel conditions. Following that, the CSI of the identifiedrelays is estimated using least squares estimation without any additional feedback. Both single and multiple relay selection cases are considered. After deriving closed-formexpressions for the asymptotic end-to-end SNR at the destination and the feedback load for different relaying protocols, we show that CS-based selection drastically reduces thefeedback load and achieves a rate close to that obtained by selection algorithms with dedicated error-free feedback.",M.

Consider a cloud-radio accessnetwork (CRAN), where the central cloud is responsible for scheduling devices to the frames' radio resources blocks (RRBs) of the single-antenna base-stations (BSs), adjusting thetransmit power levels, and for synchronizing the transmit frames across the connected BSs. Previous studies show that the jointly coordinated scheduling and power control problem inthe considered CRAN can be solved using an approach that scales exponentially with the number of BSs, devices, and RRBs, which makes the practical implementation infeasible forreasonably sized networks. This letter instead proposes a low-complexity solution to the problem, under the constraints that each device cannot be served by more than one BS but can beserved by multiple RRBs within each BS frame, and under the practical assumption that the channel is constant during the duration of each frame. The paper utilizes graph-theoreticalbased techniques and shows that constructing a single power control graph is sufficient to obtain the optimal solution with a complexity that is independent of the number of RRBs.Simulation results reveal the optimality of the proposed solution for slow-varying channels, and show that the solution performs near-optimal for highly correlated channels.",A.

7792669,"Network densification is foreseen as a potential solution to fulfill the 5G spectral efficiency requirements. The spectral efficiency is improved by shrinking base stations'(BSs) footprints, thus improving the spatial frequency reuse and reducing the number of users sharing the resources of each BS. However, the foreseen densification gains are achievedat the expense of increasing handover (HO) rates. Hence, HO rate is a key performance limiting factor that should be carefully considered in densification planning. This paper shedslight on the HO problem that appears in dense 5G networks and proposes an effective solution via topology aware HO skipping. Different skipping techniques are considered and comparedwith the conventional best connected scheme. To this end, the proposed schemes are validated via the average user rate in downlink single-tier and two-tier cellular networks, which aremodeled using the Poisson point process and the Poisson cluster process, respectively. The proposed skipping schemes show up to 47% gains in the average throughput, which wouldmaximize the benefit of network densification.",R. Arshad and H. Elsawy and S. Sorour and T. Y.

7312953,"In this work, we propose a unified approach to evaluating the CDF and PDF of indefinite quadratic forms in Gaussian random variables. Such a quantity appears in manyapplications in communications, signal processing, information theory, and adaptive filtering. For example, this quantity appears in the mean-square-error (MSE) analysis of thenormalized least-mean-square (NLMS) adaptive algorithm, and SINR associated with each beam in beam forming applications. The trick of the proposed approach is to replace inequalitiesthat appear in the CDF calculation with unit step functions and to use complex integral representation of the the unit step function. Complex integration allows us then to evaluate theCDF in closed form for the zero mean case and as a single dimensional integral for the non-zero mean case. Utilizing the saddle point technique allows us to closely approximate suchintegrals in non zero mean case. We demonstrate how our approach can be extended to other scenarios such as the joint distribution of quadratic forms and ratios of such forms, and tocharacterize quadratic forms in isotropic distributed random variables. We also evaluate the outage probability in multiuser beamforming using our approach to provide an application ofindefinite forms in communications.",T. Y. Al-Naffouri and M. Moinuddin and N.

6809217,"In this paper, we study the multicast completion and decoding delay minimization problems for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) in the case of lossy feedback. Whenfeedback loss events occur, the sender falls into uncertainties about packet reception at the different receivers, which forces it to perform partially blind selections of packetcombinations in subsequent transmissions. To determine efficient selection policies that reduce the completion and decoding delays of IDNC in such an environment, we first extend theperfect feedback formulation in our previous works to the lossy feedback environment, by incorporating the uncertainties resulting from unheard feedback events in these formulations.For the completion delay problem, we use this formulation to identify the maximum likelihood state of the network in events of unheard feedback and employ it to design a partiallyblind graph update extension to the multicast IDNC algorithm in our earlier work. For the decoding delay problem, we derive an expression for the expected decoding delay increment forany arbitrary transmission. This expression is then used to find the optimal policy that reduces the decoding delay in such lossy feedback environment.

7480418,"This paper addresses the design of adaptive subspace matched filter (ASMF) detectors in the presence of a mismatch in the steering vector. These detectors are coined asadaptive in reference to the step of utilizing an estimate of the clutter covariance matrix using training data of signal-free observations. To estimate the clutter covariance matrix,we employ regularized covariance estimators that, by construction, force the eigenvalues of the covariance estimates to be greater than a positive scalar ρ. While this feature islikely to increase the bias of the covariance estimate, it presents the advantage of improving its conditioning, thus making the regularization suitable for handling high-dimensionalregimes. In this paper, we consider the setting of the regularization parameter and the threshold for ASMF detectors in both Gaussian and compound Gaussian clutters. In order to allowfor a proper selection of these parameters, it is essential to analyze the false alarm and detection probabilities. For tractability, such a task is carried out under the asymptoticregime in which the number of observations and their dimensions grow simultaneously large, thereby allowing us to leverage existing results from random matrix theory.

7769211,"This paper addresses the problem of reducing the delivery time of data messages to cellular users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) with physical-layer rateawareness. While most of the existing literature on IDNC does not consider any physical layer complications and abstracts the model as equally slotted time for all users, this paperproposes a cross-layer scheme that incorporates the different channel rates of the various users in the decision process of both the transmitted message combinations and the rates withwhich they are transmitted. The consideration of asymmetric rates for receivers reflects more practical application scenarios and introduces a new tradeoff between the choice of codingcombinations for various receivers and the broadcasting rates. The completion time minimization problem in such a scenario is first shown to be intractable. The problem is thusapproximated by reducing, at each transmission, the increase of an anticipated version of the completion time. This paper solves the problem by formulating it as a maximum weightclique problem over a newly designed rate-aware IDNC graph. The highest weight clique in the created graph being potentially not unique, this paper further suggests a multi-layerversion of the proposed solution to improve the obtained results from the employed completion time approximation.

7482797,"Subsurface reservoir flow channels are characterized by high-permeability values and serve as preferred pathways for fluid propagation.

However, accurate reconstruction of the subsurface geological features with the EnKF is challenging because of the limited measurements available from the wells andthe smoothing effects imposed by the ℓ2-norm nature of its update step.

Numerical results suggest that the performance of the new sparse Bayesian based EnKF scheme is enhanced with the availability of seismic measurements, leading to furtherimprovement in the recovery of flow channels structures.

7272056,"This paper addresses the problem of channel impulse response estimation for cluster-sparse channels under the Bayesian estimation framework. We develop a novel low-complexityminimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator by exploiting the sparsity of the received signal profile and the structure of the measurement matrix. It is shown that, due to the bandedToeplitz/circulant structure of the measurement matrix, a channel impulse response, such as underwater acoustic channel impulse responses, can be partitioned into a number oforthogonal or approximately orthogonal clusters. The orthogonal clusters, the sparsity of the channel impulse response, and the structure of the measurement matrix, all combined,result in a computationally superior realization of the MMSE channel estimator. The MMSE estimator calculations boil down to simpler in-cluster calculations that can be reused indifferent clusters. The reduction in computational complexity allows for a more accurate implementation of the MMSE estimator. The proposed approach is tested using synthetic Gaussianchannels, as well as simulated underwater acoustic channels.

When the channel is i.i.d., it has been shown that for large n, the sum rate is equal to M log log n + M log P/M + o(1) where M is the number of transmitantennas, P is the average signal to noise ratio, and o(1) refers to terms that go to zero as n rarr infin. When the channel exhibits some spatial correlation with a covariance matrixR (non-singular with tr(R)=M), we prove that the sum rate of dirty paper coding is M log log n + M log P/M + log det(R) + o(1). We further show that the sum-rate of variousbeamforming schemes achieves M log log n + M log P/M + M log c + o(1) where c les 1 depends on the type of beamforming.

6858071,"In this paper, a low-sampling-rate scheme for ultra-wideband channel estimation is proposed. The scheme exploits multiple observations generated by transmitting multiplepulses. In the proposed scheme, $P$ pulses are transmitted to produce channel impulse response estimates at a desired sampling rate, while the ADC samples at a rate that is $P$ timesslower. To avoid loss of fidelity, the number of sampling periods (based on the desired rate) in the inter-pulse interval is restricted to be co-prime with $P$ . This condition isaffected when clock drift is present and the transmitted pulse locations change. To handle this case, and to achieve an overall good channel estimation performance, without using priorinformation, we derive an improved estimator based on the bounded data uncertainty (BDU) model. It is shown that this estimator is related to the Bayesian linear minimum mean squarederror (LMMSE) estimator. Channel estimation performance of the proposed sub-sampling scheme combined with the new estimator is assessed in simulation. The results show that highreduction in sampling rate can be achieved. The proposed estimator outperforms the least squares estimator in almost all cases, while in the high SNR regime it also outperforms theLMMSE estimator.

The paper solves the problem using a graph theoretical approach by introducing the joint scheduling and power control graph formed by several clusters, where eachis formed by a set of vertices, representing the possible association of users, BSs, and PLs for one specific PZ.

In addition,these channels as observed by multiple antennas in a neighborhood have approximately common support. The sparsity and common support properties are attractive when it comes to theefficient estimation of large number of channels in massive MIMO systems. Moreover, to avoid pilot contamination and to achieve better spectral efficiency, it is important to use asmall number of pilots. We present a novel channel estimation approach which utilizes the sparsity and common support properties to estimate sparse channels and requires a small numberof pilots. Two algorithms based on this approach have been developed that perform Bayesian estimates of sparse channels even when the prior is non-Gaussian or unknown.

5371924,"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) combines the advantages of high performance and relatively low implementation complexity.

When the channel exhibits fast time variation as it is the case with several recent OFDM-basedmobile broadband wireless standards (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, DVB-H), channel estimation at the receiver becomes quite challenging for two main reasons: 1) the receiver needs to perform thisestimation more frequently and 2) channel time-variations introduce intercarrier interference among the OFDM subcarriers which can degrade the performance of conventional channelestimation algorithms significantly. In this paper, we propose a new pilot-aided algorithm for the estimation of fast time-varying channels in OFDM transmission.

7458183,"The deluge of date rate in today's networks imposes a cost burden on the backhaul network design. Developing cost-efficient backhaul solutions becomes an exciting, yetchallenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks, including either radio-frequency (RF) backhauls or optical fibers (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution ascompared with OF, it supports the lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution is the free-space optics (FSO) as it offers both a high data rate and a relativelylow cost. The FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions, e.g., rain, fog, and line-of-sight. This paper combines both the RF and FSO advantages and proposes a hybrid RF/FSObackhaul solution. It considers the problem of minimizing the cost of the backhaul network by choosing either OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links between the base stations, so as tosatisfy data rate, connectivity, and reliability constraints. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem isequivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance,especially for reasonable prices of the hybrid RF/FSO links.

6613518,"Estimating unknown signal in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) requires sensor nodes to transmit their observations of the signal over a multiple access channel to a FusionCenter (FC). The FC uses the received observations, which is corrupted by observation noise and both channel fading and noise, to find the minimum Mean Square Error (MSE) estimate ofthe signal. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the source-node correlation (the correlation between sensor node observations and the source signal) and the inter-nodecorrelation (the correlation between sensor node observations) on the performance of the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) estimator for three correlation models in the presenceof channel fading. First, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the achieved distortion (i.e., MSE) resulting from both the observation and channel noise in a non-fading channel.Then, the effect of channel fading is considered and the corresponding distortion outage probability, the probability that the distortion exceeds a certain value, is found. Byrepresenting the distortion as a ratio of indefinite quadratic forms, a closed-form expression is derived for the outage probability that shows its dependency on the correlation.Finally, the new representation of the outage probability allows us to propose an iterative solution for the power allocation problem to minimize the outage probability under total andindividual power constraints.

At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the clipped signal, as wellas the clipping likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Furthermore, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clippingreconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers and multi-user OFDM.We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping distortion.Numerical findings are presented that depict favorable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes.",A.

To design such waveforms, conventional MIMOradar methods use two steps. In the first step, the waveforms covariance matrix R is synthesized to achieve the desired beampattern. Whereas in the second step, to realize thesynthesized covariance matrix, actual waveforms are designed. Most of the existing methods use iterative algorithms to solve these constrained optimization problems. The computationalcomplexity of these algorithms is very high, which makes them difficult to use in practice. In this paper, to achieve the desired beampattern, a low complexitydiscrete-Fourier-transform based closed-form covariance matrix design technique is introduced for an MIMO radar.

7880596,"Optical wireless communications (OWC) is a promising technology for closing the mismatch between the growing number of connected devices and the limited wireless networkcapabilities. Similar to downlink, uplink can also benefit from OWC for establishing connectivity between such devices and an optical access point.

Hence, it is important to understand the fundamental limits of communication rates over an OWC uplinkemploying IM-DD, i.e., the channel capacity. This uplink, modeled as a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) for indoors OWC, is studied in this paper, under the IM-DD constraints,which form the main difference with the standard Gaussian MAC commonly studied in the radio-frequency context. Capacity region outer and inner bounds for this channel are derived. Thebounds are fairly close at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where a truncated-Gaussian input distribution achieves the capacity region within a constant gap.

6742716,"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation scheme that is widely used in wired and wireless communication systems. While OFDM is ideally suited to dealwith frequency selective channels and AWGN, its performance may be dramatically impacted by the presence of impulse noise. In fact, very strong noise impulses in the time domain mightresult in the erasure of whole OFDM blocks of symbols at the receiver. Impulse noise can be mitigated by considering it as a sparse signal in time, and using recently developedalgorithms for sparse signal reconstruction. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the guard band null subcarriers for the impulse noise estimation and cancellation. Instead of relyingon ℓ1 minimization as done in some popular general-purpose compressive sensing schemes, the proposed method jointly exploits the specific structure of this problem and the available apriori information for sparse signal recovery.

7500144,"For several years, the completion time and the decoding delay problems in instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) were considered separately and were thought to actcompletely against each other. Recently, some works have aimed to balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics, but none of them studied a further optimization of one bycontrolling the other. This paper investigates the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion time below its currently best known solution in both perfect andimperfect feedback with persistent erasure channels. To solve the problem, the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall completion times are derived in thecomplete feedback scenario. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion time is NP-hard, this paper proposes two novel heuristics that minimize theprobability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control of their decoding delays.Afterward, this paper extends the study to the imperfect feedback scenario, in which uncertainties at the sender affect its ability to anticipate accurately the decoding delay increaseat each user. This paper formulates the problem in such an environment and derives the expression of the minimum increase in the completion time. Simulation results show theperformance of the proposed solutions and suggest that both heuristics achieve a lower mean completion time, as compared with the best known heuristics for completion time reduction inperfect and imperfect feedback.

The 1 percentfingerprinting load is used only in perturbing the local geometries of the plan coordinates.

4244643,"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) combines the advantages of high achievable rates and relatively easy implementation. However, for proper recovery of theinput, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization algorithm for joint channel and data recovery in fast fadingenvironments. The algorithm makes a collective use of the data and channel constraints inherent in the communication problem. This comes in contrast to other works which have employedthese constraints selectively. The data constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet restriction, while the channel constraints include sparsity, finite delayspread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward Kalman filter. We also suggest a suboptimalmodification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency. Simulations show the favorable behavior of both algorithms compared to other channel estimationtechniques.",T. Y.

7588201,"This paper presents a unified mathematical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, for downlink cellular networks with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base stations.The developed paradigm accounts for signal retransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of theoriginal and retransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model presents twofoldanalysis unification for the MIMO cellular networks literature. First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted (i.e., modulation scheme and receivertype agnostic) outage probability analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysisis achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO representation for theper-data stream SINR in the MIMO cellular networks. We show that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the model accuracy. To this end, we discuss thediversity-multiplexing tradeoff imposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to the temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmittedsignals. Finally, several design insights are highlighted.",L. H. Afify and H. ElSawy and T. Y. Al-Naffouri and M. S.
